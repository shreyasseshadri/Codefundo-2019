# Codefundo Idea

## Problems that we are trying to address
- Currently there is a problem where a person can fake his identity while voting because of which it is hard to implement 
a system where he can vote from different constituency.
- Citizens with disabilities cannot go to the booth to vote.
- Identifying a person through face is not always reliable or possible (some cultural restrucions that may not allow showing of face).
- The counting of votes after the election is extremely slow.
## Our solution to the above problems
- A special node incharge of counting and maintaining private keys to sensitive voter data.
- Speacial transactions of appointments will be chained to the blockchain, when a person appoints another person to vote on his behalf due to his disability.
- Using biometric scan such as fingerprint to ascertain the identity of the individual. A value can be hashed from this 
  which can only be decrypted at a special node in the blockchain.
- A map reduce cluster which will be used in the special node that counts the results.
